You found this? Huh? Well lucky you!

## Bugs and suggestions
Virgil is a WIP (approximately 20% done at that), there will be bugs and missing things. Bugs will happen. If you have a bug or suggestion, submit an issue (maybe a pr with it).

Note: Do not create issues regarding YouTube playback, this is liable to break at any time given how pissy they are with downloading (unless you have a pr that fixes it, usually a version bump of `ytdl-core` does it).
