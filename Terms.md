## V. Your Content

Nothing in these terms grants us ownership of your intellectual property, nor does anything in these terms grant you ownership of our intellectual property. You are solely responsible for content you submit and/or transmit through the service.

## VI. Your Responsibility

You agree to indemnify us from legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account(s) on the service. Both you and us agree to notify the other party of any legal claims for which you may have to indemnify us as soon as reasonably possible. If we fail to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you will not have to indemnify us for damages that you could have defended against or mitigated with prompt notice. You agree to allow us to control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify us, and to cooperate with those efforts. We agree not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.

## VII. Disclaimers

You accept all risk of using the service and content on the service. As far as the law allows, we and our suppliers provide the service as-is, without any warranty whatsoever.

We may hyperlink to other services not operated by us. We do not make any warranty about services run by others, or content they may provide. Use of services run by others may be governed by other terms between you and the one running service.

This document only applies to the publicly provided service operated by us, not any self-hosted copy.

## VIII. Limits on Liability

Neither we nor our suppliers will be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages that could not have been reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms.

## IX. Feedback

We welcome your suggestions and feedback. To leave feedback, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Wolftallemo/Virgil/issues). You agree that we will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you provide, and that we wonâ€™t have to notify you that your feedback was used, get your permission to use it, or pay you. You agree not to submit feedback or suggestions that you believe might be confidential or proprietary, to you or others.

## X. Disputes

The laws of the State of Pennsylvania will govern any dispute related to these terms or your use of our services. You and the company agree to seek injunctions related to these terms only in court in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Neither you nor us will object to jurisdiction, forum, or venue in those courts.

## XI. General Terms

If a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. Otherwise, that provision should be removed.

WHERE THE TERMS OF SERVICE ISSUED BY OUR THIRD PARTIES CONFLICTS WITH OURS, THE TERMS OF THE THIRD PARTY SERVICE WILL PREVAIL.

Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.

These terms embody all the terms of agreement between you and us about use of the forum. These terms entirely replace any other agreements about your use of the service, written or not.
